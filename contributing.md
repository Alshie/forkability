# Contributing to Forkability

Some of the things a would-be contributor might want to do are:

1. [Raise a bug report](#raising-a-bug-report)
2. [*Request* support for a language](#requesting-language-support)
3. [*Add* support for a language](#adding-language-support) (you get any awesome points for doing this)
4. [Contribute actual code](#contributing-code)
5. [Raise an issue with what makes a project forkable at all](#suggesting-general-changes)

But first, the golden rule:

# The golden rule of pull requests

If you're going to make a pull request, make sure you've done two things before making it:

1. You've run `npm test` to ensure that you haven't broken anything. Any pull requests which have caused tests to fail will probably be rejected.
2. You've written tests to cover your additions, and that includes, where possible, testing bug fixes.

# Raising a bug report

If in your use of the program you find something that looks unexpected or broken, take the following steps:

1. Go to the [issues page](https://github.com/basicallydan/forkability/issues)
2. Search for a similar issue
	a. If you've found it, put a :+1: to say you've found it
	b. [Consider Contributing actual code](#contributing-code) to fix the problem
	c. Stop here :)
3. If the issue hasn't been raised before, [raise it](https://github.com/basicallydan/forkability/issues/new), and be as detailed as you possibly can. Were you using the JavaScript module? Or were you using forkability on the command line? Or was it perhaps on the web app? What is your computer's operating system? As much detail as possible makes it easier to fix bugs.

Forkability should undergo frequent reviews to keep up with opinion about what makes an open-source project forkable.
